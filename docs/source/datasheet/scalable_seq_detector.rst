Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each Logic Block (CLB) consists of 12 Logic Elements (LEs) as shown in :numref:`fig_clb_arch`.
All the pins of the LEs are directly wired to CLB pins without a local routing architecture.
Feedback connections between LEs are implemented by the global routing architecture outside the CLBs.
